The following two tutorials about using the Python 3.74 Pandas library for data frames. The code is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file. The data is from Kaggle.com. \

Feel free to use the code and the data for educational purposes.

I recommend downloading both files into the same folder and uploading both files into Jupyter Notebook. 

Also, feel free to send any comments or suggestions to scmcmahan@sbcglobal.net.
